I joined the BBC as a software engineer in Future Media for Audio & Music Interactive just over 5 years ago.

It was just before [the first release](http://derivadow.com/2007/10/18/programme-support/) of [BBC Programmes](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes), and it was a couple of months before the [iPlayer](http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer) streaming service on the web launched in December 2007.

I came to the BBC because having developed a number of research prototypes in academia for a few years, I wanted to build stuff with a significant number of real users. And I've certainly been able to do that, having worked:

* on a page for each artist on [BBC Music](http://www.bbc.co.uk/music) and [clickable tracklists for programmes pages](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01pfbjw#segments)
* a year at [Radio 1](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/) working on things like the [chart](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/chart/singles), [live lounge](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/livelounge/) and getting [twitter to drive Scaletrix cars](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio/2011/02/using_twitter_to_control_a_slot-car_race_mistajam_vs_scott_mills.html)
* on the [Radio 1/1Xtra homepage](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2011/09/radio1_homepage_software_technical.html) project
* on a [number](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/bigweekend/2010/) of [music](http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/festivals/glastonbury/2011/) [events](http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/festivals/readingandleeds/2011/) sites, both in the good old static html days and with the new [music](http://www.bbc.co.uk/events/e9wmxj) [events](http://www.bbc.co.uk/events/edvg9r) platform
* on [the launch](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2012/10/introducing_bbc_iplayer_radio.html) of [iPlayer Radio](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/)

It's been incredible. I've learnt so much, not just from the technical side but also as an individual. I've worked with really brilliant developers, designers and editorial - making great friends along the way. I've worked on some amazing projects, and written code that is used by millions of users each week.

However, all good things must come to an end and I've decided it's time for me to move on.

Friday was the last day at the BBC for me, and today I'm starting as a technical lead at [Sidekick Studios](http://www.sidekickstudios.net).
