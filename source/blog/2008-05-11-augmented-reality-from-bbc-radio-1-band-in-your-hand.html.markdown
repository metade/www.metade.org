It's brilliant to see the ["Band in Your Hand"](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/bigweekend/2008/feature/bandinyourhand.shtml) Augmented Reality feature built for Radio 1's [Big Weekend](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/bigweekend/). There's even a video showing Scott Mills trying it out!

Read more about it on the [Radio Labs blog](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radiolabs/2008/05/radio_1s_band_in_your_hand.shtml).

While talking about Augmented Reality, I was browsing through the recent O'Reilly ["Augmented Reality - a practical guide"](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9781934356036/) by Stephen Cawood and Mark Fiala. It looks like a great introduction to the subject, describing some of the new augmented reality frameworks that have improve on the trusty old [ARToolKit](http://www.hitl.washington.edu/artoolkit/). However, I felt that the demo application that the book presents could have explored the tangible augmented reality side of things more.
