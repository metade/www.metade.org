I hosted a [Young Rewired State](http://yrs.io/) group at [Lostmy.name](https://www.lostmy.name), where a group of youngsters (Donald, Saul and Theo) joined us for a week to design and build a prototype.

They made [Kollect](http://web.archive.org/web/20150912205139/http://hacks.youngrewiredstate.org/events/festival-of-code-2015/ko-llect), an application for local businesses to share their surplus food with people in need.

Watch them present their pitch in style:
