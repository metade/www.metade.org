After nearly 11 years at Southampton University, I am finally leaving and heading off to London.

It's been quite a ride: starting as an undergraduate, doing my PhD, and then four great years as a research associate/fellow at both [IAM](http://www.iam.ecs.soton.ac.uk) and [LSL](http://www.lsl.ecs.soton.ac.uk).

Tomorrow I start a new adventure, as a Software Engineer at Audio & Music Interactive at the BBC...
