I'm a geek and it's awesome! I'm going to the London Hack Day event next month, guess I need to find a come up with something nice to hack up...

There's a load of stuff I've been thinking about and planning to tinker with, but I think it would be great to participate in something new and unique that I wouldn't be just be able to do on my own.

I'm really looking forward to it now!
