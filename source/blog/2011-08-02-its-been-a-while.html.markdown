I’ve written two blog posts in 3 years - I have to admit I’ve not been very good at this blogging thing!

I have been pretty busy over the last few years at the BBC. I did a lot of work on [BBC Music](http://www.bbc.co.uk/music), and I spent a year with the [Radio 1/1Xtra Interactive team](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1) where I had lots of fun. More recently I’ve been working on the [music event sites](http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/festivals/glastonbury/2011/).

Away from work, I’ve been to a few hack days including a couple of [Music Hack Days](http://musichackday.org/), [Linked Gov Hack Camp](http://linkedgov.hackcamp.org.uk/hacks) and a few [Rewired State](http://rewiredstate.org/) events.

I’m going to try imposing a new rule on myself: I will force myself to write up anything I work on that I spend more than an hour on!
