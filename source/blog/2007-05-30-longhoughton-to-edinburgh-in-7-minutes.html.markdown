Back in the 1960s, my grandparents made [an incredible home video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPTei47Hxew). They recorded their trip from [ Alnwick](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=Longhoughton,+Alnwick,+Northumberland,+NE66&sll=54.162434,-3.647461&sspn=7.414808,21.75293&ie=UTF8&z=12&iwloc=addr&om=1) to Edinburgh - a [trip of around 90 miles](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=d&hl=en&saddr=Longhoughton,+Alnwick,+Northumberland,+NE66&daddr=Edinburgh&sll=55.43007,-1.616483&sspn=0.112208,0.33989&ie=UTF8&om=1&z=9) reduced to 7 minutes!

From what I understand, they mounted the camera to the car's dashboard and then my grandmother had to press the camera shutter every eight seconds or so. It's amazing to see the old cars and trucks on the road, and then right at the end there's a brand new Mini!

It's also fun to see how little time they spend behind other cars - as soon as one comes up they've overtaken it!
