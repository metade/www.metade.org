At BBC Audio and Music Interactive, I'm one of the software engineers working on the [BBC Music Discovery team](http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/developers/are). This week we [launched](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2008/07/bbc_music_artist_pages_beta.html) the [BBC Music Beta](http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/beta/), which focuses in particular on publishing information about the artists broadcast on the BBC. You can read more about the site on [Tom Scott's blog](http://derivadow.com/2008/07/28/the-all-new-bbc-music-site-where-programmes-meet-music-and-the-semantic-web/) and [BBC Radio Labs](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radiolabs/2008/07/music_beta_and_linked_data.shtml).

Matthew Shorter describes at the [bottom of his post](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/matthew_shorter/) how to use MusicBrainz to find a given artist. Here's a little something to make that a touch easier: a BBC Music/MusicBrainz [bookmarklet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet)!

Drag this [BBC Music/MusicBrainz]() link to your bookmarks bar in your browser. Now, when you're on an artist page (e.g. [Coldplay](http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/artists/cc197bad-dc9c-440d-a5b5-d52ba2e14234)) click on the bookmarklet to switch between BBC Music and MusicBrainz artist page.

Enjoy!
