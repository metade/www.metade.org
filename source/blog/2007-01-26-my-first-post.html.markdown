Hi. My name is Patrick. I'm currently a researcher at the University of Southampton, working with semantic web techniques for multimedia, particularly in the cultural heritage domain.

You can find more about me on [metade.org](http://www.metade.org).   This is my first ever blog post _ever_. Ouch!

Anyway, I plan to use this blog to describe what I'm up to: papers/posters/presentations/bits of code and anything else I come up with...
