The band is named after a line in the BBC TV mini-series The Singing Detective; a character (Philip Marlow) says that the word \"elbow\" is the most sensuous word in the English language, not for its definition, but for how it feels to say it.\n\nAcclaimed for their innovative sound and front-man Guy Garvey's evocative candid lyrics, Elbow have received vast critical acclaim and been endorsed by major artists Radiohead, Coldplay, Blur, R.E.M. and U2 despite minor commercial success during much of their career (The Velvet Underground's co-founder John Cale selected Elbow's \"Switching Off\" as one of his eight chosen records on the BBC's Desert Island Discs radio programme). Since winning the 2008 Mercury Music Prize for their fourth album, The Seldom Seen Kid, commercial success is finally beginning to match Elbow's critical acclaim and status among fans.","imageURL":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/music\/images\/artists\/126x71\/3cb3928a-526c-4a3d-93c5-53315fa9bde0.jpg"},{"listeners":864910,"type":"Group","played":"yes","playcount":26023161,"start_year":2002,"tags":["electronic","indie","psychedelic","indie pop","alternative"],"label":"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/music\/artists\/c485632c-b784-4ee9-8ea1-c5fb365681fc\" target=\"top\">MGMT<\/a>","synopsis":"MGMT , formerly named \"The Management\" (\"The Management\" was occupied by another artist so the band shortened \"The Management\" to \"MGMT\"), is an American musical duo based in Brooklyn, New York, consisting of Ben Goldwasser and Andrew VanWyngarden.

The duo are signed to Rob da Bank\u2019s Sunday Best Records in the UK\/Europe and Sage Francis\u2019s Strange Famous Recordings in the USA. Their debut album \u2018Angles\u201d was released on 12\/05\/08 in the UK and 02\/09\/08 in the US. The band is most well-known for the 2007 song \"Thou Shalt Always Kill\". The name \"Scroobius Pip\" is an intentional misspelling of the Edward Lear poem, The Scroobious Pip. Scroobius Pip attended St Thomas More High School for Boys in Westcliff, Essex and was brought up in and around Southend-on-Sea.\n\nSince March 2007 they have undertaken multiple UK, US and European tours. The band have also appeared at the Glastonbury Festival, Reading and Leeds Festival 07 and 08, Bestival 07 and 08, Lowlands, Fuji Rock Festival, Coachella, Monolith Festival and have also supported RJD2, EL-P, Mark Ronson, Basement Jaxx and Fujiya & Miyagi.\n\nThe duo undertook a three-date mini-tour in July 2008, performing in London, Manchester and Glasgow. The shows were presented as 'motivational seminars', using four forms of motivation\u2014Love, Lessons, Storytelling and Religion\u2014to link their songs throughout the show. The duo ended each gig with covers of the Sugababes' 2005 song Push The Button and Prince's 1991 track Cream.\n\nThey have also appeared on the BBC's new music show SOUND , and Scroobius Pip has interviewed and performed live on Stephen Merchant's show on BBC 6 Music.\n\nA spoof video posted on YouTube shows the pair auditioning for The X Factor (TV series) in front of Simon Cowell, Sharon Osbourne and Louis Walsh. A montage of clips of judges' comments are added to their profanity-laden performance of what Scroobius Pip says is \"It Ain't No Fun by Snoop Dogg, featuring Warren G, Nate Dogg and Kurupt.\" The clip, titled \"Dan Le Sac Vs Scroobius Pip Look For The X-Factor\", was featured in \"The 10 Best Clips of the Month\" in the October 2008 edition of Q magazine.\n\nIn late 2008 they collaborated with De La Soul and re-recorded their debut single \"Thou Shalt Always Kill\" this is to be released 19\/01\/09 on Sunday Best.","imageURL":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/music\/images\/artists\/126x71\/fb8fb96b-e9aa-4cdd-b3b0-b49eaa0f32dd.jpg"},{"listeners":1483,"type":"Person","played":"no","playcount":9540,"start_year":null,"tags":["electro","new wave","dub step","ambient","electronic"],"label":"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/music\/artists\/f58c4610-bde9-4fb7-b3c5-13808a548d8c\" target=\"top\">Rob da Bank<\/a>","synopsis":"This is a redirect from a title with another method of capitalisation.

James (with whom he shares a birthday), co-producing \"En-Trance To Exit\" on the Analogue Bubblebath EP for Exeter's influential Mighty Force Records. This was followed by his first solo outing, \"My Splendid Idea\", under the name Schizophrenia for the same label.\n\nSoon after, he teamed up with Mark Pritchard. The pair recorded under a host of pseudonyms, including the popular Reload (featuring experimental techno and ambient music), Global Communication (primarily ambient), and Jedi Knights (electro funk and house music), plus lesser-known aliases Chameleon and Link & E621. Global Communication's 1994 ambient album 76:14 is widely considered to be a landmark of the genre.\n\nThe pair also founded their own record label, Evolution, which is sometimes informally referenced as Evolution (Crewekerne) to differentiate it from other record labels with the same name. A compilation of early Evolution material was released jointly by Evolution and Warp Records in 1995 as The Theory of Evolution. The label name later changed to Universal Language Productions and launched a sublabel, Heard, then became E3 before finally winding down operations. The labels launched early releases from artists such as Matthew Herbert, as well as Middleton & Pritchard under their various guises.\n\nAside from Schizophrenia, Tom's solo projects include The Modwheel (experimental house music), Cosmos (progressive house music) and AMBA (ambient\/classical). As of 2006[update], Cosmos's \"Take Me With You\" was his most successful track. In Summer of 2007, Middleton abandoned the AMBA moniker, while still focusing on the ambient genre fusing classical traditions with electronica, featuring orchestral, choral and electro acoustic arrangements. A new EP, Excursions 1 was released on 10 September 2007 while the album Lifetracks was released on Big Chill Recordings on 1 October 2007 under the name Tom Middleton.\n\nPredominantly using the Cosmos and Modwheel monikers (and his own name) Middleton has remixed numerous artists including Kerri Chandler, Orbital, Kylie Minogue, Coldplay, Underworld, Fluke, Super_Collider, Prince, Spiller, Model 500, The Beloved, Rob Dougan, Pulp, Leftfield, Ian Pooley, Dubtribe Sound System, All Saints, Goldfrapp, Lamb, R\u00f6yksopp, Gotan Project, Amp Fiddler, Mighty Dub Katz and Bebel Gilberto.","imageURL":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/music\/images\/artists\/126x71\/0799ced4-249a-4129-b5ea-5bc174b6007c.jpg"},{"listeners":192790,"type":"Group","played":"yes","playcount":4455477,"start_year":null,"tags":["electronic","indie","indie pop","pop","falsetto"],"label":"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/music\/artists\/daeec599-bf5d-4428-994a-e76ba5f86e2f\" target=\"top\">Passion Pit<\/a>","synopsis":"Passion Pit is an American electronic band from Cambridge, Massachusetts.

They are currently signed to Full Time Hobby Records in the United Kingdom. They are self-described as being heavily influenced by 70's Krautrock bands such as Can and Neu! as well as early-90's electronic music artists like Aphex Twin. The origins of the band's name come from a character in the movie The Karate Kid as well as the brand of a record player . The lines \"We're not a couple of shadowboxers\/Oh\/Oh\/Just two Anglo-Saxons\" from the 2008 track Butterfingers may be a comment on the band name and how it is perceived.\n\nThe first several years after the band's formation were spent in relative obscurity; however, they began to see a drastic spike in popularity between 2003 and 2006 thanks in large part to very favorable reviews from prominent music publications such as NME and Pitchfork Media. They were also the subject of an episode of the MTV2 documentary series This Is Our Music in 2006. The song \"Collarbone\" has been featured in ads for both Jaguar's 2007 \"Gorgeous\" campaign as well as Miller Lite's \"Bar Stool\" directed by Tarsem Singh.\n\nThe current members of the band are:","imageURL":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/music\/images\/artists\/126x71\/41a94033-8b12-4c60-a22c-38c78801e363.jpg"},{"listeners":214,"type":"Person","played":"no","playcount":602,"start_year":null,"tags":["indie","love x x","i would rather beat myself to death with a hammer than listen to this","penis","cunt"],"label":"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/music\/artists\/60c693ce-2121-47c5-bc20-975e43137e48\" target=\"top\">Zane Lowe<\/a>","synopsis":"Zane Lowe (born Alexander Zane Wilberforce Reid Lowe on 7 August 1973) also known as 'Zipper', is a radio DJ and television presenter.

Though often unshaven, he does not usually sport what would be considered a full beard.\n\nForeman moved to Brighton in 2001 to study at the University of Sussex. After seeing beatboxer Rahzel play live, he was impressed that beatboxing could sustain a whole show rather than simply provide interludes within the context of a broader presentation.\n\nHe battled to become UK Beatbox Champion 2006 and retained his title in 2007 making him the first beatboxer in UK history to win 2 championships in a row.\n\nAs well as accomplished solo beatboxing, Beardyman uses music technology such as the Korg Kaoss Pad 3 in order to loop and sample his vocals. Through his use of looping tools he effectively produces whole dj sets where the records are constructed live from his vocalisations, as well as live production of original material.\n\nHis interest in exploring new musical technology is also evident in the innovative 'Battlejam' club nights he hosts with 2007 DMC champion turntablist JFB. Here the live looping technology is augmented with live sampling of the audience to make the hook of instantly composed tracks and even live video sampling and scratching.\n\nHe has gigged and recorded with MC Klum-Z-Tung as part of MC\/beatbox duo The Gobfathers. Together, they presented Get Lucky TV's 'The Freestyle Show\u201d in 2005, and also appeared as traffic wardens in a hidden camera show for E4.\n\nIn 2008 he collaborated with visual artist mr_hopkinson, to produce a video called 'Monkey Jazz' which visually describes the live looping process. Since then they have worked together to produce various multi-camera videos of Beardyman's performances filmed at the Cube Microplex. Beardyman has also appeared on stage for improvised live shows with mr_hopkison providing visual backdrops from images instantly searched from the internet in response to audience suggestions.\n\nBeardyman often incorporates humour into his act. He has impersonated Elvis, dressed as a monkey on stage at Bestival and once posed as an Austrian climate change lecturer, \"Professor Bernhard Steinerhoff\", before breaking into his set, with over 1 million views on YouTube.\n\nBeardyman also features in the Funky Sage ring tones in which he plays a floating head who beatboxes and gives good advice. His video \"Kitchen Diaries\" which features him combining beatboxing with cooking has been viewed more than 3 million times on YouTube. \"Kitchen Diaries\" also makes an appearance in 'South Coast', a Brighton based documentary about Hip Hop in the UK.\n\nBeardyman has somewhat of a cult following, with many of his supporters sporting the phrase \"Deus Ex Barba\" - latin for \"God out of beard\". This is a reference to the phrase Deus Ex Machina. This has mainly spread over the internet, on websites such as YouTube or MySpace.\n\nBeardyman cites the Lyrebird as a form of inspiration, and hosted a BBC Radio 4 documentary about the bird entitled, \"Beardyman and the Mimics\".\n\nDuring November 2006 he took part in a series of children's choir charity concerts called Young Voices appearing in Manchester, Birmingham, London and Belfast.\n\nOn 10 February 2007 he made an appearance on the second episode of the BBC One show When Will I Be Famous. Despite winning over the studio audience and two of the three judges, he came second in a public vote. On the same day, he was on also on the Channel 4 show Homemade where he was profiled as the weirdest beatboxer around.\n\nBeardyman supported Groove Armada on their UK tour in 2007.\n\nOn 8 May 2008 he performed at Google UK with Nathan \"Flutebox\" Lee.\n\nOn 25 March 2008 he appeared as a YouTube Hero on BBC Three show Lily Allen and Friends\n\nOn 27 September 2008 he was the MC for Fatboy Slim's Big Beach Boutique 4 in Brighton.\n\nOn 22 November, 2008, he performed at YouTube Live in San Francisco, California\n\nOn May 28 2009 Beardyman appeared on the Scott Mills Show on BBC Radio 1. He participated in the feature \"What's Becky's Forte?\" by teaching Becky how to beatbox.\n\nIn June 2009, Beardyman appeared at the 2009 Glastonbury Festival, and The Glade the following month.\n\nIn July 2009, he appeared at the Udderbelly during it's residency at Southbank in London. This was for a ensemble comedy show called \"Beardyman's Complete and Utter Shambles\" featuring JFB, MC Klum-Z-Tung, Beardyman's comedian brother Jay Foreman, visual artist mr_hopkinson, guitarist 'j'm black, saxophonist Hellanor and comedian Reggie Watts. The show took the technology based entertainment experiments of Battlejam to a more theatrical comedy club setting. A reduced cast version of the show renamed \"Beardyman's Unplanned Explosion\" went on to appear at the Udderbelly at the Edinburgh Festival in late August 2009.\n\nOn 14 July 2009, Beardyman appeared on BBC1 show, As Seen On TV, beatboxing the Monty Python theme. The two teams had to guess what song he beatboxed. Comedian Jason Manford received the point. On 23 July 2009, he reappeared on the show, this time beatboxing the Big Brother UK theme. Again Jason Manford received the point.\n\nBeardyman is sampled on the track \"Hard Funk Core\" by \"Pin vs. Puzzle\" from the album \"Vuuv Festival 2008\" on the label Planet B.E.N Records","imageURL":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/music\/images\/artists\/126x71\/cb9221fb-6e7c-4ae8-b8e5-8e35d11154a8.jpg"},{"listeners":7,"type":"Group","played":"yes","playcount":34,"start_year":null,"tags":[],"label":"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/music\/artists\/b7ca7429-4ffb-4528-8e7e-6d6b8bd20770\" target=\"top\">Kitty Daisy & Lewis<\/a>","synopsis":"Kitty, Daisy & Lewis are a three-piece band comprising the teenage siblings of the Durham family.

Kitty, Daisy and Lewis do not use computers or any digital format during the recording process. They live with their parents in Kentish Town, north London. All of them have left school, but previously attended Acland Burghley School.\n\nThe band are signed to the Sunday Best record label who released their second single \"Mean Son Of A Gun\", a song originally cut by Johnny Horton in the 50s, with the B-side \"Ooo Wee\" which they first heard on a 78rpm record sung by Louis Jordan. This was released on 45rpm, CD and a limited edition 78rpm vinyl. The tracks were recorded at home. The vinyl was also cut by Lewis using his own equipment (though possibly at The Exchange Mastering Studios, which is owned and run by his father Graeme). They have supported artists such as Jools Holland, Mika, Billy Bragg, Mark Ronson and Razorlight at London's Earls Court Arena. They toured with Coldplay around America in July and August 2009[citation needed]. They also played the main stage at Bestival in 2006, 2007 and 2008 and played twice at Glastonbury in 2007 and 2008.

They appear in the current 2009 Dustin Hoffman \/ Emma Thompson film Last Chance Harvey performing \"Mean Son Of A Gun\". The song is used later in a clothes store changing room scene.\n\nWhen performing live, their parents, Graeme Durham and Ingrid Weiss play guitar and double-bass. Graeme Durham is a founding member and mastering engineer at The Exchange recording studios in London, and Ingrid Weiss is the former drummer of The Raincoats and was encouraged to play the double bass by Kitty Daisy & Lewis.\n\nTheir 2008 self-titled album received a positive review from The Times, who said \"the vibe is irresistible\".

Through his labels Acid Jazz, Talkin' Loud, and latterly Brownswood Recordings, he has been associated with the careers of countless well-known artists of the 1990s such as Erykah Badu and Tony Rich plus Jamiroquai. He is also well known as a radio DJ. After starting out on pirate radio, and having shows on various legal London-based radio stations, most noticeably including Kiss FM dance music station, he was recruited to the BBC's youth-oriented Radio 1 in 1998. Peterson is known for his eclectic musical selections, and has even been occasionally mentioned as the new John Peel. However whilst the late John Peel had an \"anything goes\" range of tastes displayed on his show, Peterson's focus has always been Jazz music, generally Modern Jazz, with a strong emphasis on its use in a club environment, mixed with associated music styles.\n\nWidely acclaimed as a musical tastemaker, he spreads his influence on music listeners around the world mostly through his Worldwide radio show on BBC Radio 1 which is also broadcast live on the Radio 1 website and available for audio streaming online for seven days from broadcast. He also does another version of the show which gets syndicated to radio stations all over the world, such as FM4 in Austria and Radio Helsinki in Finland, and does a British Airways in-flight entertainment show too. Parallel to this, his frequent DJing gigs around the world also have cemented a worldwide following -- perhaps rather apt, given the name of his radio show is Worldwide. He has recently been involved with the start of new record label Brownswood Recordings, named after the road in North London where the house he used to live is, though he has since had to move out of after his record collection became too big, and which now acts as a warehouse for his enormous collection of vinyl records. Incidentally, this new label should not be confused with Talkin' Loud, the previous label he was involved with, imprint label called Brownswood Records (note: Records NOT Recordings) which was used to release music from the United Future Organization as well as other Japanese associated projects.","imageURL":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/music\/images\/artists\/126x71\/4c4e3121-4d12-4f7a-a77c-5becd849fb3c.jpg"},{"listeners":20477,"type":"Artist","played":"yes","playcount":118195,"start_year":null,"tags":["house","electronic","electronica","funky house","funk"],"label":"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/music\/artists\/d36a9d53-550e-4c44-bb07-f8de594deaf8\" target=\"top\">Crazy P<\/a>","synopsis":null,"imageURL":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/music\/images\/artists\/126x71\/d36a9d53-550e-4c44-bb07-f8de594deaf8.jpg"},{"listeners":14868,"type":"Artist","played":"no","playcount":97732,"start_year":null,"tags":["drum and bass","punk","emo","japanese punk","dnb"],"label":"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/music\/artists\/b489d194-8a85-410c-96aa-09747d924cf8\" target=\"top\">Friction<\/a>","synopsis":null,"imageURL":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/music\/images\/artists\/126x71\/b489d194-8a85-410c-96aa-09747d924cf8.jpg"},{"listeners":8618,"type":"Group","played":"yes","playcount":80138,"start_year":null,"tags":["indie","indie pop","rock","folk","psychedelic"],"label":"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/music\/artists\/e9dfa0b7-6fbf-49ee-a6df-686bb0c041d9\" target=\"top\">It Hugs Back<\/a>","synopsis":null,"imageURL":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/music\/images\/artists\/126x71\/e9dfa0b7-6fbf-49ee-a6df-686bb0c041d9.jpg"},{"listeners":97861,"type":"Person","played":"yes","playcount":2559672,"start_year":null,"tags":["electronic","new rave","electro","experimental","glitch"],"label":"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/music\/artists\/93eb7110-0bc9-4d3f-816b-4b52ef982ec8\" target=\"top\">Metronomy<\/a>","synopsis":"Metronomy is an electronic music group formed by Joseph Mount in Totnes, Devon, England in 1999.
